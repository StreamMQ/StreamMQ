== Functional Features

1. **Unsubscribe Command**: Allow users to unsubscribe from MQTT topics.

2. **TLS Support**: Enable TLS/SSL encryption for MQTT connections.

3. **Authentication**: Implement authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, client certificates) for connecting to MQTT brokers.

4. **Clean Session**: Allow users to specify whether to start a clean session or resume an existing session when connecting to the broker.

5. **Retained Messages**: Support retained messages and provide an option to publish messages as retained.

6. **Last Will and Testament (LWT)**: Allow users to specify a last will and testament message to be sent by the broker if the client disconnects unexpectedly.

7. **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Implement support for different QoS levels when publishing and subscribing to messages.

8. **Connection Status**: Display the connection status (connected/disconnected) in the CLI.

== Non Functional Features

Error Handling: Enhance error handling throughout the application. Provide informative error messages when connections fail, messages cannot be published, or subscriptions encounter issues.

1. Quality of Life Features:

Implement tab completion for commands and flag values to improve the user experience.
Allow users to configure default connection settings in a configuration file, so they don't need to specify them repeatedly on the command line.
Add an option to save and load previous commands for easier reuse.
Interactive Mode: Implement an interactive mode where users can navigate through different functionalities (e.g., connecting, publishing, subscribing) using a menu-based interface.

2. Subscription Management:

Add functionality to manage subscriptions dynamically. Allow users to subscribe and unsubscribe from topics while the application is running.
Implement wildcard subscription support for subscribing to multiple topics simultaneously.
Message Persistence: Integrate message persistence features such as storing published messages in a database or file system, allowing users to retrieve and query them later.


3. Monitoring and Logging:

Provide real-time monitoring of MQTT traffic, including message rates, connection status, and error logs.
Allow users to enable debug logging to troubleshoot connectivity or messaging issues.

4. Custom Commands:

Allow users to define custom commands or scripts to automate repetitive tasks or perform complex actions.

5. Cross-Platform Support: Ensure the CLI tool works seamlessly across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) without any compatibility issues.

6. Documentation and Help:

Provide comprehensive documentation, including usage examples, command references, and troubleshooting guides.
Implement a built-in help command to display usage instructions and available options for each command.

7. Unit Tests and CI/CD:

Write unit tests to validate the functionality of individual components.
Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines to automate testing, building, and releasing new versions of the CLI tool.
